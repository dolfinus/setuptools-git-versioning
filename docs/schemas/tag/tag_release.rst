.. _tag-release:

Release is a git tag
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

For example, current repo state is:

.. code:: bash

    commit 86269212 Release commit (HEAD, master)
    |
    commit e7bdbe51 Another commit
    |
    ...
    |
    commit 273c47eb Long long ago
    |
    ...

And you want to use git tag as a release number instead of duplicating it in
``setup.py`` or other file.

Just :ref:`install setuptools-git-versioning <installation>`
and then tag the commit with a proper release version (e.g. ``1.0.0``):

.. code:: bash

    commit 86269212 Release commit (v1.0.0, HEAD, master)
    |
    commit e7bdbe51 Another commit
    |
    ...
    |
    commit 273c47eb Long long ago
    |
    ...

Your package version is now ``1.0.0``.

If tag number had ``v`` prefix, like ``v1.0.0``, it will be trimmed.


Version number template
""""""""""""""""""""""""

By default, when you try to get current version, you'll receive version
number like ``1.0.0``.

You can change this template in the config file:

- ``setup.py``:

    .. code:: python

        setuptools.setup(
            ...,
            setuptools_git_versioning={
                "template": "2022.{tag}",
            },
        )

- ``pyproject.toml``:

    .. code:: toml

        [tool.setuptools-git-versioning]
        template = "2022.{tag}"

In this case, for tag ``3.4`` version number will be ``2021.3.4``

.. note::

    If branch name is not :pep:`440` compliant, like ``"release/1.2.3"``,
    use :ref:`tag-formatter-option` option
